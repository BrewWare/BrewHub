BrewHub is an open-source platform designed to be a central repository for homebrew app information. It aims to simplify the process of discovering, sharing, and managing homebrew applications across various platforms. Think of it as a community-driven app store specifically for homebrew.

## What Makes BrewHub Different?

BrewHub takes a unique approach to homebrew app distribution. Unlike traditional app repositories that host the files themselves, BrewHub is entirely **serverless**.  This means:

* **Direct Downloads from Developers:**  Instead of downloading apps from a central server, BrewHub links directly to the developer's repository. This ensures accurate download counts for developers and gives them full control over their releases.
* **JAMstack Architecture:** BrewHub leverages the power of the JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) and GitHub Actions to create a fast, secure, and scalable platform.  GitHub Actions automate the build and deployment process, keeping the app information up-to-date.
* **Decentralized Distribution:** By relying on developer repositories, BrewHub promotes a decentralized distribution model. This reduces the risk of single points of failure and empowers developers to manage their own releases.

## What BrewHub Offers

* **Centralized App Discovery:** Browse and search for homebrew apps across different categories and platforms.
* **Detailed App Information:** Access comprehensive details about each app, including descriptions, screenshots, installation instructions, and popularity.
* **Easy Submission Process:** Contribute your own homebrew apps to the repository with a streamlined submission workflow.
* **Community Driven:** Engage with other homebrew enthusiasts, discuss apps, and contribute to the platform's growth.
* **Open Source and Extensible:** BrewHub is built on open standards, allowing for community contributions and extensions.
* **Platform Agnostic:** While initial development was for 3DS/DS(i) support, eventually all homebrew consoles will be supported.

## NOTICE!

BrewHub forks:

* **UniversalDB:** No longer affiliated with BrewHub (known as TitleDB 2.0 at the time) due to unethical development practices. (The only affiliation was that Epicpkmn11 wrote a Python script to help update the app's JSON, then forked the repo without credit...scummy).
* **hShop:** An illegal piracy app that is a fork of UniversalDB, which is in turn a fork of BrewShop...obvious reason why.

Neither repo nor anyone affiliated is allowed to contribute to this repo.
<h1>Support the original, not the imitation!</h1>
